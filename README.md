# Introduction

This is my final project for course "Visual Computing And Learning" at Peking University.

It is a simple SVG Renderer. It's GUI is based on Qt, but all the rendering is done by my own code —— My functions render the SVG image pixel by pixel.

Till now, it only supports some of the basic elements and traits. My future plan is to implement a full-featured SVG Renderer, and one day I may refactor it into Rust for learning.
